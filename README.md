Posture Detection System for Preventing Desk Job-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders
The Posture Detection System addresses the growing issue of poor sitting posture, which is especially prevalent in today’s work-from-home environment. Static work, which involves slow muscle contraction and prolonged posture holding, can lead to musculoskeletal disorders. While traditional posture detection methods rely on wearable sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes, they come with drawbacks such as the need for constant power, discomfort from physical sensors, false readings, and increased costs due to additional components.

This project uses a non-intrusive approach by leveraging OpenCV and the MediaPipe machine learning framework. The system detects bad posture through real-time analysis of the user’s sitting position and provides alerts to correct it. Additionally, it monitors eye-screen interaction and stress levels through heartbeat analysis, ensuring a comprehensive solution for maintaining ergonomic health during prolonged desk work.
